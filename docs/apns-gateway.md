# APNS Gateway

`apnsgateway` is a standalone relay binary that keeps the iOS app's Live Activity (Lock Screen widget + Dynamic Island) updating while the app is suspended, without requiring any APNs configuration on individual bandwidth-monitor instances.

## Why a separate binary?

Only the Apple Developer team that owns the app's bundle ID can push to it via APNs — which means the key must live somewhere. Rather than requiring every self-hoster to obtain their own paid developer account and APNs auth key, `apnsgateway` is the single place that holds the key:

- The iOS app registers its push token directly with the gateway, naming its own server's URL.
- The gateway polls that server's **existing, unmodified** `/api/interfaces` and `/api/interfaces/history` endpoints, builds the content-state, and pushes to APNs.
- **Individual bandwidth-monitor instances need zero APNs configuration or new code.**

`apnsgateway` is deliberately a separate binary (`make build-gateway`), not a mode flag on the main server — the main server assumes router-level access (raw sockets, netlink, often root) that a relay meant to run on any ordinary host has no use for.

## Building

```bash
make build-gateway
# produces: ./apns-gateway
```

Cross-compile for Linux (common deployment target):

```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o apns-gateway ./apnsgateway
```

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables. Every variable except the TLS paths and APNs credentials has a sensible default.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `LISTEN` | `:8443` | Listen address, or a comma-separated list of them (`192.0.2.9:8443,[2001:db8::9]:8443`; bracket IPv6 literals). The gateway always serves HTTPS (iOS App Transport Security rejects plain HTTP). |
| `TLS_CERT_FILE` | *(required)* | Path to the TLS certificate (PEM). |
| `TLS_KEY_FILE` | *(required)* | Path to the TLS private key (PEM). |
| `APNS_KEY_FILE` | *(required)* | Path to the APNs auth key (`.p8`) from [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com) (Keys → Apple Push Notification service). Keep it `chmod 0600`. |
| `APNS_KEY_ID` | *(required)* | 10-character key ID from the Apple Developer portal. |
| `APNS_TEAM_ID` | *(required)* | Apple Developer team ID. |
| `APNS_BUNDLE_ID` | *(required)* | App bundle ID (e.g. `com.example.BandwidthMonitor`). |
| `APNS_PUSH_INTERVAL` | `10s` | How often to push an update to each registered device. |
| `APNS_MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES` | `16777216` (16 MiB) | Maximum response size accepted from a polled server. The `/api/interfaces/history` endpoint can return several MB per interface at the default 24h/1Hz retention, so this must be large enough to cover a full history response. |

## Running

```bash
export TLS_CERT_FILE=/etc/apns-gateway/server.crt
export TLS_KEY_FILE=/etc/apns-gateway/server.key
export APNS_KEY_FILE=/etc/apns-gateway/AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8
export APNS_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXX
export APNS_TEAM_ID=YOURTEAMID
export APNS_BUNDLE_ID=com.example.BandwidthMonitor
./apns-gateway
```

The gateway logs a startup line confirming all settings and then starts accepting registrations.

Graceful shutdown is handled automatically on `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` (drains active connections, up to 5 seconds).

## API

### `POST /api/liveactivity/register`

Registers (or refreshes) a device's Live Activity push token. The iOS app calls this every time its Live Activity token changes and periodically to keep the subscription alive.

**Request body (JSON):**

```json
{
  "token": "<hex push token>",
  "environment": "sandbox|production",
  "serverURL": "https://your-bandwidth-monitor.example.com:8080",
  "interface": "eth0"
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `token` | The device's APNs push token for this Live Activity, as a hex string. |
| `environment` | `sandbox` for Xcode dev builds, `production` for App Store / TestFlight builds. |
| `serverURL` | The public HTTPS (or HTTP) URL of the bandwidth-monitor instance this device is monitoring. Must resolve to a public IP address — private/loopback/link-local addresses are rejected (SSRF mitigation). |
| `interface` | The interface name to monitor (e.g. `eth0`). If empty or not found, the gateway picks the first WAN interface. |

**Response:** `{"status":"ok"}` on success, or an HTTP error with a plain-text message.

### `GET /healthz`

Returns `200 ok`. Use this for load balancer health checks or uptime monitoring.

## Security

### SSRF mitigation

Accepting an operator-supplied `serverURL` is inherently an SSRF shape (the gateway makes outbound requests to the supplied target). The gateway defends against this without requiring authentication — no secret is needed from iPhone users or self-hosting operators:

- `validateServerURL` rejects any URL whose host resolves to a private, loopback, link-local (including the `169.254.169.254` cloud-metadata pattern), multicast, or unspecified address.
- `checkPublicHost` is called again **immediately before every fetch**, not just at registration, to narrow the DNS-rebinding window where a hostname resolves to a public IP at registration time but to a private one later.
- Redirects are not followed.

This costs the real use case nothing: a bandwidth-monitor server can never legitimately live at a private address, since the gateway reaches it over the public internet.

### Other hygiene

- Per-source IP rate limiting on registration (20 registrations per 5-minute window).
- Global subscription cap (5 000 active subscriptions).
- Response size cap (`APNS_MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES`) on fetched server responses.
- Per-fetch timeout (8 seconds).
- Subscriptions that the app stops refreshing expire after 1 hour (TTL).
- Dead tokens (APNs 410 / `BadDeviceToken` / `Unregistered`) are dropped immediately.

### Registration is unauthenticated by design

No secret is required to register. The threat model is that registering a `serverURL` is a potential SSRF vector, handled above, not that registrations need to be gated — the app never surfaces any setup step to the end user, and requiring a shared secret would make self-hosting needlessly complicated.

## Notes

- **Filtered history fetches:** The gateway narrows its `/api/interfaces/history` requests with `?iface=<name>&since=<Unix ms>` so a current server sends only the last hour of one interface's history (a few KB) instead of every interface's full 24h retention (multiple MB). The parameters are additive, so no version negotiation is needed: servers that predate them ignore them and return the full map, which the gateway's own content-state windowing (and `APNS_MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES`) absorbs transparently.
